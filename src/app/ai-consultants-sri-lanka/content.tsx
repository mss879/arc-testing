const faqs = [
    {
        q: "What does an AI Consultant actually do?",
        a: "A legitimate AI consultant bridges the gap between commercial strategy and deep technology. Unlike software engineers who only write code, an AI consultant audits your operational workflows, identifies bottlenecks costing you money, determines if AI can mathematically solve those bottlenecks with a positive ROI, and then architects the deployment roadmap. They tell you what NOT to build just as often as what TO build."
    },
    {
        q: "How much does AI Consulting cost in Sri Lanka (2026)?",
        a: "Initial feasibility studies and operational audits typically range from LKR 150,000 to LKR 400,000. If engaging traditional 'Big 4' management consultancies, strategy reports can exceed LKR 1.5 Million before a single line of code is written. Agile engineering consultancies typically embed the consulting cost into the final deployment pipeline, bringing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) down significantly."
    },
    {
        q: "Why do most AI implementation projects fail?",
        a: "Two reasons: 'Garbage In, Garbage Out' (GIGO) and 'Solutionism.' First, companies try to train AI on messy, unstructured Excel sheets, resulting in hallucinating AI models. Second, agencies sell off-the-shelf AI tools to solve problems the business doesn't actually have (Solutionism). A true consultant fixes the data infrastructure first."
    },
    {
        q: "Should we hire an in-house Data Scientist instead of a consultant?",
        a: "A senior Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer in Colombo commands a salary of LKR 400,000 to LKR 800,000+ per month. However, building an AI pipeline requires more than just a Data Scientist; it requires Cloud Architects, UI Developers, and Prompt Engineers. Engaging an external consultancy provides a fractional, multi-disciplinary team for a fraction of the annual payroll cost."
    },
    {
        q: "What is the difference between a traditional software agency and an AI consultancy?",
        a: "A software agency asks: 'What do you want us to build?' An AI consultancy asks: 'Why are your profit margins shrinking in Q3, and what unstructured data do we have to automate that cost center?' Software agencies execute instructions; AI consultancies dictate strategy based on algorithmic feasibility."
    },
    {
        q: "What industries in Sri Lanka benefit most from AI consulting?",
        a: "Tourism and hospitality benefit from dynamic pricing algorithms and AI concierge systems. Apparel and manufacturing gain from supply chain demand forecasting and quality control vision systems. Financial services leverage fraud detection, credit scoring models, and automated KYC compliance. Healthcare is beginning to adopt diagnostic imaging analysis and patient triage automation. The common thread is that any industry with high-volume, repetitive data processing stands to gain the most from AI automation."
    },
    {
        q: "How long does an AI consulting engagement typically last?",
        a: "A feasibility audit is typically completed in 2 to 4 weeks. A Proof of Concept (PoC) build takes 6 to 12 weeks. Full enterprise deployment—including data pipeline architecture, model training, API integration, UI development, and employee onboarding—can extend to 4 to 8 months depending on scope and data readiness."
    },
    {
        q: "Is my company data safe when using AI APIs like OpenAI or Anthropic?",
        a: "It depends entirely on which API tier the consultant uses. Consumer-grade and free-tier APIs may use your data to train future models. Enterprise-tier APIs (such as OpenAI Enterprise or Anthropic's zero-retention contracts) guarantee that your data is never stored, logged, or used for model training. A competent AI consultant will always specify the data retention policy in writing before any integration begins."

                                The boardroom discourse in Colombo regarding Artificial Intelligence has reached a fever pitch. Propelled by media narratives surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative automation, executives are under immense pressure to "deploy AI" to remain competitive. However, this reactionary approach has created a lucrative market for predatory consulting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A concerning trend in the Sri Lankan corporate sector is the deployment of "Solutionism"—buying an off-the-shelf AI chatbot or expensive software license to solve a fundamental operational problem that does not actually exist. <strong>AI is not a product; it is a mathematical capability.</strong> Deploying it without a rigorous operational audit leads to bloated budgets, frustrated employees, and negative ROI.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The distinction between a genuine AI consultant and a software vendor is critical. A vendor will present a polished demo of their pre-built tool and convince you it solves your problem. A consultant will spend weeks inside your organization—interviewing department heads, auditing data pipelines, mapping customer journey friction points—before even mentioning a technology stack. The consultant's primary output is not software; it is a <strong>strategic thesis</strong> backed by operational telemetry that mathematically justifies whether AI intervention will yield a positive return within 12 to 18 months.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Sri Lanka specifically, this distinction matters because the local market is flooded with software agencies rebranding themselves as "AI companies" after adding a simple ChatGPT API wrapper to their existing products. True AI consulting requires deep expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), Vector Database architecture, and—critically—an understanding of the specific regulatory and data infrastructure challenges unique to the Sri Lankan corporate environment.

                                            The primary duty of a legitimate AI consultant is risk mitigation. Before a single line of code is written, the consultant must audit the company's data infrastructure, identify high-friction workflows, and prove—mathematically—that an algorithmic intervention will reduce Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) or increase operational yield. Often, a good consultant will advise a company that they are <em>not ready</em> for AI. That honesty is the hallmark of a trustworthy engagement.

                                The single greatest barrier to AI adoption in Sri Lanka is not budget; it is data infrastructure. An AI model, regardless of its sophistication, is entirely dependent on the quality of the data it ingests. This principle is known in computer science as <em>Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO)</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many established local enterprises operate with deeply fragmented data. Customer records are trapped in legacy ERP systems, standard operating procedures exist only as unindexed PDF files, and financial forecasting is scattered across localized Excel spreadsheets. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before deploying a custom AI agent to "automate customer service" or "predict inventory," an expert consultant must first architect a <strong>Vector Database</strong> pipeline. This process involves extracting, cleaning, and structuring the company's legacy data into a format that a Large Language Model can actually comprehend and retrieve via Semantic Search (RAG architecture).

                                One of the most overlooked aspects of AI deployment is data sovereignty and regulatory compliance. Sri Lanka enacted the <strong>Personal Data Protection Act No. 9 of 2022</strong>, which imposes strict obligations on how organisations collect, process, and store personal data. Any AI consultant operating in Sri Lanka must architect systems that comply with these regulations or expose their client to significant legal liability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When an AI model processes customer data — whether it is analysing purchase history, parsing support tickets, or scoring credit applications — that data is being transmitted to external servers. If the consultant uses consumer-grade API endpoints, that data may be stored, logged, and potentially used to train future public models. This represents a catastrophic data breach from both a legal and competitive standpoint.
