        q: "What are the top-rated software development companies in Sri Lanka for 2026?",
        a: "The top-rated software companies in Sri Lanka for 2026 include WSO2, Virtusa, IFS, 99x, LSEG Technology, Calcey Technologies, Rootcode, and Surge Global. The full list of 22 reviewed companies spans enterprise middleware, digital engineering, ERP, product engineering, capital markets technology, cloud-native development, IoT, and travel tech.",
    },
    {
        q: "Why is Sri Lanka considered a good destination for software outsourcing?",
        a: "Sri Lanka offers strong English proficiency (higher than many South Asian neighbours), a well-educated STEM workforce of 175,000+ IT professionals, hourly rates of $20–$60 USD (50–70% savings over UK/US), a convenient UTC+5:30 timezone that overlaps with European and Middle Eastern business hours, and growing government commitment including a 30 billion LKR (~US$98M) digital budget allocation in 2026. Unlike larger outsourcing markets, Sri Lanka competes on quality over volume — producing ~10,000 selective IT graduates annually.",
    },
    {
        q: "How much does it cost to hire a software development company in Sri Lanka?",
        a: "Hourly rates for software development in Sri Lanka typically range from $20 to $60 USD depending on the company size, specialisation, and seniority of developers. Boutique agencies and startups charge $20–$35/hour, mid-market firms charge $35–$50/hour, and established enterprise-grade companies charge $45–$60/hour. Monthly retainers for dedicated developers typically range from $2,500 to $5,000/month. This represents significant savings compared to UK rates ($80–$150/hour), US rates ($100–$200/hour), and is competitive with Indian rates ($15–$50/hour) while often offering higher per-capita quality.",
    },
    {
        q: "What services do software companies in Sri Lanka typically offer?",
        a: "Sri Lankan software companies offer a comprehensive range of services including: custom software development, mobile app development (iOS & Android), web application development (React, Next.js, Angular), enterprise resource planning (ERP), quality assurance and testing, UI/UX design, cloud migration and DevOps, AI and machine learning solutions, API integration, IT staff augmentation, and managed services. Many firms also specialise in vertical solutions for fintech, healthtech, travel tech, and e-commerce. An emerging specialisation is AI-native development — chatbots, voice agents, and intelligent automation.",
    },
    {
        q: "Which programming languages and technologies are popular among Sri Lankan software companies?",
        a: "The most widely used technologies include JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Next.js, Angular, Node.js), Java (Spring Boot — the dominant enterprise language), Python (Django, Flask, AI/ML), C# (.NET for enterprise clients), PHP (Laravel for web applications), and mobile frameworks (React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin). Cloud platforms (AWS is dominant, followed by Azure and GCP) and DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins) are standard. AI-focused firms increasingly use LangChain, vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate), and LLM orchestration frameworks.",
    },
    {
        q: "How do I choose the right software development partner in Sri Lanka?",
        a: "Evaluate partners across five pillars: (1) Technical expertise — does their stack align with your requirements? (2) Portfolio and case studies — have they successfully delivered in your domain? (3) Communication standards — do they use agile methodologies with transparent project management tooling? (4) Security compliance — look for ISO 27001, SOC2 practices, and GDPR awareness. (5) Scalability and retention — can they scale the team, and is their developer retention above 80%? Additionally, request reference calls with existing clients and verify their presence on independent review platforms like Clutch or GoodFirms.",
    },
    {
        q: "Is Sri Lanka better than India for software outsourcing?",
        a: "It depends on your priorities. India offers unmatched scale (5 million+ developers) and lower entry-level rates. Sri Lanka offers higher average English proficiency, smaller team sizes with more senior attention per project, comparable quality at competitive rates, and a timezone that works better for European clients. For projects requiring 3–30 developers with strong communication and design quality, Sri Lanka often outperforms. For projects requiring 100+ developers or highly specialised niche skills, India's larger talent pool may be advantageous. Many clients use both markets for different project types.",
    },
    {
        q: "What is SLASSCOM and how does it relate to Sri Lankan software companies?",
        a: "SLASSCOM (Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies) is the national chamber representing the IT/BPM industry in Sri Lanka. It serves as the primary industry body advocating for policy, talent development, and international market access. SLASSCOM members include most major software companies in Sri Lanka. The organisation publishes industry reports, organises events, and runs initiatives supporting startup growth and talent pipeline development. Being a SLASSCOM member is generally considered a positive indicator of a company's standing in the local industry.",
    },
    {
        q: "What is the best custom software development company in Sri Lanka for startups?",
        a: "For startups, Calcey Technologies, Rootcode, Addix, and Fcode Labs are often the best fit. These software development companies in Sri Lanka specialise in rapid MVP development, modern tech stacks (React, Next.js, cloud-native), and offer flexible engagement models tailored to startup budgets.",
    },
    {
        q: "How do Sri Lankan software engineers rank globally?",
        a: "Sri Lankan software engineers are highly regarded globally, known for their strong problem-solving skills and design sensibility. The country focuses on quality over quantity, producing elite talent that frequently wins global competitive programming awards. Engineers from top Sri Lankan institutions are actively recruited by leading international tech giants.",
